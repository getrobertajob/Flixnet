# Flixnet
Netflix Clone named "Flixnet". Yeah I got bored one day and felt like coding and my Netflix account was on hold due to forgetting to pay for Netflix. Sure I had plenty of money and could have just paid the standard monthly bill. But where would be the fun in that. Instead lets just code a competitor to a billion dollar business.   LOL
